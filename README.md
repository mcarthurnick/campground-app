# Campground App
## The only campground app you will ever need.

In order to run this app you will need to do a couple of things. First, clone this repository onto your local machine. Once you have this on your machine, then run:
```
npm install

npm run dev
```

Once you have done that, go to your web browser and type in: http://localhost:8000 . From there you will have access to the campground list.

If you would like to add a campground, feel free. You can use a campground image in the /public/assets/ folder or just copy and paste a link from a Google search.

If you want to edit a campground or delete it, then the buttons for the specific campground are below the description.

Enjoy!
